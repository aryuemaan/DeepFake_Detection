# Deepfake Detection Website

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for a Deepfake detection website. Users can upload videos to the platform, and the system will analyze and determine if the content is likely a Deepfake or not.



## Features

- **User-friendly Interface**: An intuitive web interface for users to upload and analyze videos.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Background processing to handle Deepfake detection without causing delays for users.
- **Detailed Results**: Clear presentation of detection results with relevant details and confidence scores.
- **User Feedback**: Mechanism for users to provide feedback on detection results.
- **Security**: Implementation of secure video uploads, user authentication, and protection against common web vulnerabilities.
